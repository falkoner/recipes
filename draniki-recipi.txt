Ingredients:
- 12 potatoes
- 1 onion
- oil
- salt

Directions:
1. Peel, wash and grate potatoes and the onion (the onion will help you keep grated potatoes from turning brown). Use a grater with small holes. Add salt and mix until a smooth even consistency is obtained.

2. Heat the frying pan with vegetable oil. Put a full tablespoon of mixture from the bowl onto the frying pan and form a small pancake. Flip over once browned and crispy - about 2 to 3 minutes each side.

3. Serve hot with sour cream.
